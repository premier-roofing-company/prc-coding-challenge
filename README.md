# Premier Coding Challenge

## Background
The Software Research and Development Team at Premier is focused on building fast, efficient, and intuitive software for our hundreds of teammates and thousands of yearly customers.

We are looking for developers with a strong background in React, React Native, and Node with experience using REST APIs.

## Introduction to Our Challenge

This take-home challenge is designed to showcase your talents in React and Node and your ability to leverage REST APIs. 

We have left a majority of the challenge open-ended to test your ability to interpret simple business logic and to allow for your creativity to show. 

Do not let the fear of taking the "wrong approach" interfere with your ideas. Above all, we are looking for clean and well-written code that solves the problem as described. The rest is up to you!

## The Problem
Every day, an employee is given a list of six new addresses they must visit. They begin and end each day at their office. They find themselves driving rather inefficient routes as they try to make their way to each stop. 

After a few days, they propose a solution: a route planner! Their request is relatively simple: they'd like to enter in six street addresses, along with their start/end point, and receive a list back showing them the fastest route stopping at each address.

## Your Solution
Your solution should be a SPA (single-page application) that uses one or more of the following languages: 

 - Node.js
 - React.js
 - React Native

Your route planner should accept: 

 - Starting/End Location (they will be the same in this instance) as a street address
 - Six unique street addresses
 
 Your route planner should produce: 
 
 - An ordered list showing the most efficient route reaching all addresses. Efficiency should be based upon distance, not driving time. Distance should be evaluated based upon actual roadways, not "as the crow flies." 

You will have to locate an appropriate REST API to meet your application's needs. Google Maps API is free-to-use and should provide you with the information needed to form your routes in the language of your choice.

There are many online applications that serve this purpose. A simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=route%20planner) should provide inspiration for the functionality of your application. Note: *your application does not need to incorporate map views*.

## Deadline and Submission
You will have one week to complete the challenge.

Please send your finished submission as a public GitHub repository link via email to jduvarney@premier-roofing.com with the subject line "`lastname` Take-Home Submission."

Your projects will be run and tested for functionality, so include any needed instructions on how to "start" your application in your readme file. 

If you have questions or need more time to complete your project, please contact jduvarney@premier-roofing.com with the subject line "`lastname` Take-Home Questions."

Good luck, and we are excited to see what you can produce!
